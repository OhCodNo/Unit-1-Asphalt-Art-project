# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built-in Neighborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

   - My project utilizes a 32x32 grid and paints a Character known as Rella (My own character). The image depicts my character doing a winking expression and is a head profile like usual art of characters, kind of like a profile picture.

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   - I like the comitment I did to get the project working, but for the project itself? Well, one would be the fact that the methods work with each other, and the second one being the different methods I tried and how I utilized them to make the art. 

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   - Well, I must say the process of drawing the character with different methods was quite tedious, I would want to improve organization or the size of the project better.
